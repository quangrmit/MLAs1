Can try many possible methods by do not need to show all the code 

Data splitting:
- NO MANUAL SPLIT!!!
- Needs to check the distribution and the correlation of the splits (Will try time series and normal split and decide based on this criteria)

Possible model methods:
- Linear regression (Regularization)
- Polinomial regression (How to ?)
- Hyper parameters = learning rate, alpha, 

EDA methods (only on the training data):
- Tukey's rule
- scatter plot
- boxplot

Feature selection (only based on EDA):
- maybe discard features that have little to no correlation

Transforming methods: Needs to research on when to use these
- Power transformer
- 
Questions for professor after the assignment:
- Why does polynomial regression worse than the linear regression
